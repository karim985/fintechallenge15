## RoboAdviser 
![](images/RoboAdviser.png)

Retirement plan providers want us to increase their client portfolio—especially by engaging young people. Because machine learning and NLP are disrupting finance to improve the customer experience, we decided to create a robo-advisor. Both existing and potentially new customers can use this robo-advisor to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement.

## Project Plan 


1- We will Configure the initial robo advisor: by Defining an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.

2- Building and testing the robo advisor: by Making sure that our bot works and accurately responds during the conversation with the user.

3- Enhancing the robo advisor with an Amazon Lambda function: by Creating an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. This includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and integrating it with the bot.
